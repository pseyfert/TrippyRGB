# playing with the Trippy RGB

Starting from a template by [Mitch
Altman](http://cornfieldelectronics.com/cfe/projects.php), I edited a few lines
of code.

I somewhat claim Mitch included a few bugs to improve the learning exercise
(Finding and fixing someone else's bugs which appear to make no sense about why
they are there whatsoever). So … maybe don't pick anything from me but rather
take the original :)

Writeup on what I did to follow … some day … maybe … if I have time … and
nothing better to do … and am in the mood for it.
